Sometimes I am bored and I write code.

## Projects

### [Sushi View](https://github.com/bigwhale/sushiview-releases)

A minimal PDF reader for Android. No AI, no cloud sync, no annotations — just PDF reading.

**No features:**
- PDF reading with vertical scrolling
- Table of contents navigation with browser-style back/forward history
- Reading position memory across sessions

### [Sushi Lang](https://github.com/bigwhale/sushi-lang)

A compiled programming language with a Lark parser frontend and LLVM backend that produces native binaries. Built as a learning exercise in compiler design, combining safety features inspired by a blend of C, Go, Rust, and Python.

**Features:**
- Static typing with compile-time borrow checking
- Type-safe error handling with Result types
- Generics with compile-time monomorphization
- Pattern matching on enums
- Native code generation via LLVM

If you find Sushi stuff entertaining, or useful, you can buy me a coffee!

Disclaimer: I don't drink coffee, I will spend the money on cheap electronics.
